This is JODReports version 4.0.0 development by Barry Pearce, a fork of the 
original project. 

This fork contains the following features:

Support for LibreOffice 6+ - notably repeating table rows now works again!
Based on Java 8. 



Please see

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/jodreports/
  
for the original documentation.

Requirements
============

JODReports requires Java 1.8 or later.

To create documents in formats other than OpenDocument Text (odt) 
please use JODConverter library. As the original library is no longer 
maintained the recommended JODCOnvertor fork is by Simon Braconnier 
and may be found here:
